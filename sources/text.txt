I offer you my ancestors,
 my dead men,
 the ghosts that living men have honoured in marble:
 my father's father killed in the frontier of Buenos Aires,
 two bullets through his lungs, bearded and dead,
 wrapped by his soldiers in the hide of a cow;
 my mother's grandfather -just twenty four- heading a charge of three hundred men,
 now ghosts on vanished horses.
 I offer you whatever insight my books may hold.
 whatever manliness or humour my life.
